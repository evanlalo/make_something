# make_something

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file like below and place it in the root of the project. Update the `API_URL` to match your environment.

```sh
DEBUG=true
API_URL=http://localhost
```
2. Login with either your user (in production) or use the admin credentials.
    * This assumes you have the API up and running either locally or you are pointing at the production API.
    * Username: admin@example.com
    * Password: admin
